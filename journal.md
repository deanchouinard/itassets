Had some trouble yesterday and this morning trying to figure out how to implement
a parent child relationship that didn't include current_user. The solution was
nested routes, which I discovered on Stack Exchange.

Re-familiarized myself with the app

Made some fixes on how to get child records; had some unnecessary functions in pages controller

Made the office code a link to the office show page and listed computers that belong to that office via
the computer_allocations table.

Switched back to Textmate. Too much trouble trying to learn vim while
also learning Rails. Will give it another go once I get rolling with
Rails.
