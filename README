IT Assets

IT Assets is a flexible equipment inventory and technical support ticket system. It
supports multiple companies at multiple sites with multiple user permission
levels.

As an IT Director I ran across and used many IT inventory and trouble ticket
systems. IT Assets brings together the best of those systems along with some
insights I picked up along the way.

After an account is created, you define an Office, which is a combination of
a Site (physical location) and Company.

You then add Employees and Computers located in the office and correlate the two
in order to create your equipment inventory.

If your organization has multiple offices you can define those as well giving
you the capability to keep tract of equipment in multiple locations.

A flexible reporting package allows you to generate reports of any
combination of offices, sites, and companies.

* Define your Lookup values. Lookup values are used to populate many
drop down lists on the forms. They system comes with some already defined
so you can easily see how to create new values. You can quickly add these
as you need them.

NY 55500.

* Make an Office by matching up a Site and Company. You can create multiple
combinations of Sites and Companies to suite your organizational circumstances.

remove the Alex/grey User.
