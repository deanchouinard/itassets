IT Assets

IT Assets is a flexible equipment inventory and technical support ticket system. It
supports multiple companies at multiple sites with multiple user permission
levels.

As an IT Director I ran across and used many IT inventory and trouble ticket
systems. IT Assets brings together the best of those systems along with some
insights I picked up along the way.
