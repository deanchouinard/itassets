<h3>Site</h3>
<p>A Site is a physical location -- an address.
  </p>

<h3>Company</h3>
<p>
A Company is the name of a company.
</p>

<h3>Office</h3>
<p>
An Office is the combination of a Site and Company. This is the mechanism
that allows you to configure a company at multiple sites and/or multiple companies
at one site.
</p>
<p>
  Typically, you will use the Office concept to designate the location and
  ownership of assets.
  </p>

<h3>User</h3>
User defines the users of the system. They can be:
<ul>
  <li>Administrators
  <li>Support
  <li>User
</ul>
<p>
  Equipment is assigned a User, which then relates it to an office, which relates
  it to a company and location.
  </p>
  
<h3>Lookup</h3>
<p>
The Lookup facility enables you to define choices for many of the drop down lists in the system.
</p>
<p>
  You can define values for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Computer Manufacturers
    <li>Computer Types
    <li>Operating Systems
    <li>Software Publishers
    <li>Technical Support Ticket Types
    <li>Backup Tape Destinations
  </ul>
    
<p>Lookups give your database consisteny and factilitate reporting while giving you the
  flexibility to customize data in your system.
  </p>
  
  
<h3>Computer</h3>
<p>
Computer defines the physical computer hardware in your system. They are usually servers,
desktops, or laptops; but, can be expanded to include switches, routers, or any other piece
of hardware you want to track by using the Lookup facility.
</p>
<p>
  For example, lets say I wanted to track staplers. I would first create a new
  Manufacturer lookup value and then a new Type value. I could then enter my staplers
  into the database and assign them to users. If I wanted I could also assign
  asset tags to them and enter that into the database as well.
</p>


<h3>Computer Allocation</h3>
<p>
Computer allocations allow you to assign hardware to a specific user. Through the user
you know the location of the hardware.
</p>

<h3>Software</h3>
<p>
Software defines software products.
</p>

<h3>Software Allocations</h3>
<p>
  Software Allocations allow you to assign software to specific users.
  </p>
